    "emerging_skills": ["emerging1", "emerging2"],
    "market_demand": 85,
    "future_demand": 90,
    "growth_rate": 25
}
```

### Customizing Skill Normalization

The system uses simulated data based on:
- **Job Market Trends**: LinkedIn, Indeed job posting patterns
- **Technology Trends**: GitHub, Stack Overflow developer surveys
- **Industry Reports**: Gartner, Forrester, IDC projections
- **Learning Platform Data**: Coursera, Udemy, edX course popularity

## 🔧 API Integration

The JSON output is designed for easy integration:

```python
# Get structured data for your application
guidance_text, json_data = career_ai.generate_guidance(user_profile)

# Access specific recommendations
top_career = json_data["career_recommendations"][0]
learning_path = json_data["learning_path"][0]
skill_gaps = json_data["skill_gap_analysis"][0]
```

## 🎨 Output Files

The system generates two output files:
- `career_guidance.txt` - Human-readable guidance
- `career_guidance.json` - Structured data for applications
